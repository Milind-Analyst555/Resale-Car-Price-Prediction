# Resale-Car-Price-Prediction

Data science can solve the problem of price prediction for resale cars by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns and relationships between car features and their prices. Factors like brand, model, year, mileage, and condition can be used as input to predict a fair price.

 	By building a predictive model using machine learning algorithms, the model can learn from the data to accurately estimate the resale price of a car based on its characteristics. This helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions about pricing.
  
According to results we explore various regression algorithms and we achieved accuracy up to 88.6% for Random Forest Regressor model got the highest accuracy results.

In conclusion, developing a price prediction model using data science techniques can provide valuable insights and accurate estimations for the resale car market. By analyzing historical data and using machine learning algorithms, the model can consider various factors such as Brand, model, year, mileage, and condition to predict the fair price of a car. This empowers buyers and sellers with the information needed to make important decisions with  fairness in the pricing of resale cars.
